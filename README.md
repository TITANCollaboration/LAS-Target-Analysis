# LAS-Target-Analysis#

This repository contains code to analyze the post-ablation target data. 
## Repitition_Test.py ##
This script can be used to investigate the mirror positioning and step sizing variation for ablated targets that have been repeatedly ablated in the same pattern. 

## Target_Image_Anlaysis.py ##
This script takes the ablation measurements from ImageJ and the and determines the step sizes and conversion factor between mirror and target coordinates.

## data_plotter.py ## 
This script is used to generate plots for various targets and studies.
